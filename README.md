# Machine_Project-with-SVR-Model

This repository contains a machine learning project implemented in Python, focusing on a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model.

## Overview

The main goal of this project is [provide a brief overview of the project's purpose and objectives]. It leverages the SVR model to [mention the specific task or prediction the SVR model is designed for].

## Project Structure

- **/data**: This directory contains the datasets used for training and testing the SVR model.
- **/models**: The implementation of the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model.
- **/notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- **/scripts**: Additional scripts used in the project.

## Support Vector Regression (SVR) Model

### Overview

Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a type of machine learning model used for regression tasks. Unlike traditional regression models, SVR is effective in capturing non-linear relationships in the data.

### Implementation Details

The SVR model in this project is implemented using [mention the library or framework, e.g., scikit-learn]. The hyperparameters and training details can be found in [specific file or notebook].

### Training

To train the SVR model:

1. Navigate to the `/notebooks` directory.
2. Open the `SVR_Training.ipynb` notebook.
3. Follow the instructions to load the data and train the SVR model.

### Evaluation

To evaluate the SVR model:

1. Navigate to the `/notebooks` directory.
2. Open the `SVR_Evaluation.ipynb` notebook.
3. Follow the instructions to load the trained model and evaluate its performance.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use the project, run the code, and reproduce the results. Include any dependencies that need to be installed.
